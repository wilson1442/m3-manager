The AI engineer successfully built a multi-tenant M3U management panel from scratch, implementing core features like user authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations for M3U playlists. Key developments included a light/dark theme, super admin user management with tenant assignment, and M3U playlist auto-refresh. The engineer also added comprehensive channel search with stream URL copy, online status probing, and detailed stream metadata extraction. Significant effort was dedicated to UI/UX, including fixing CSS variable interpretation and complex JSX div closure issues. The latest work focused on categories management, M3U export, and integrating a  field to monitor stream connection details and expiration dates, overcoming nested JSON parsing and date format challenges. A persistent issue remains the in-app web player not consistently playing HLS streams, acknowledged by the engineer as likely a browser policy or test environment limitation.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an M3U management panel with password protection and multi-tenant support.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **User Roles:** Super Admin (creates tenants, users for any tenant) and Tenant Owner (creates users within their tenant, views only their tenant's data).
*   **M3U Management:** Ability to add, delete, and edit M3U playlists.
*   **User Management:** Admins can create and edit users (name, password), assigning them to specific tenants.
*   **Theme:** Light/dark mode toggle for users.
*   **M3U Refresh:** Automatic hourly refresh of M3U playlist content, with a manual refresh option.
*   **Channel Search:** Search channels within playlists.
*   **Stream Details:** Display channel name, group, and playlist source.
*   **Stream Interaction:** Copy stream URL, probe stream for online status/metadata, built-in web player to preview streams (HLS/M3U8 support).
*   **Categories:** View all categories from playlists, select channels using checkboxes, export selected channels to M3U.
*   **Events Page:** Monitor specific categories; events display collapsible categories in a table format.
*   **Player API Integration:** Add an optional  URL field to playlists. Fetch and display external JSON data (max connections, active connections, expiration date in MM/DD/YYYY format) from this API. Refresh player API data.

<current_work>
The most recent successful feature implemented is the Player API integration. This allows users to associate a  with M3U playlists. The backend () now fetches and parses JSON data from this external API, specifically extracting , , and  from a nested  object. A crucial enhancement involved converting the  (provided as a Unix timestamp) into a  format and setting  based on the API's . On the frontend (), an input field for  has been added to the playlist creation/edit forms. The fetched API data (Max Connections, Active Connections, Expiration Date, and Last Checked timestamp) is displayed on the respective M3U playlist cards, complete with a refresh button to update the data manually. This feature was tested successfully with a real  URL, showing accurate data parsing and display.
