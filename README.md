## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install (Ubuntu 24.04)

```bash
# Download the installer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilson1442/m3-manager/main/install-m3u-panel.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x install-m3u-panel.sh

# Run installer
sudo ./install-m3u-panel.sh
```

The installer will prompt you for:
- Installation directory (default: `/opt/m3u-panel`)
- Domain name or IP address
- **Cloudflare Tunnel configuration** (optional)
- Admin username and password

### Cloudflare Tunnel Support

The installer now supports Cloudflare Tunnel out of the box:

1. When prompted, answer "yes" to using Cloudflare Tunnel
2. Enter your Cloudflare tunnel URL (e.g., `https://app.example.com`)
3. The installer automatically configures:
   - Backend CORS for Cloudflare domain
   - Frontend to use Cloudflare URL
   - Proper routing instructions

**Example Cloudflare Tunnel Config:**
```yaml
tunnel: your-tunnel-id
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/credentials.json

ingress:
  - hostname: app.example.com
    path: /api/*
    service: http://localhost:8001
  - hostname: app.example.com
    service: http://localhost:3000
  - service: http_status:404
```

## 🔐 Security

### Recommendations
1. Change default admin password immediately
2. Enable HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
3. Configure firewall (UFW) to only allow necessary ports
4. Use scheduled backups
5. Keep system updated: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
6. Use strong passwords for all users

### Enable HTTPS
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start
```bash
sudo systemctl status m3u-backend --no-pager -l
sudo journalctl -u m3u-backend -n 50
```

### Can't Access Web Interface
```bash
# Check services
sudo systemctl status nginx m3u-backend m3u-frontend

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
```

### Database Issues
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mongod
sudo journalctl -u mongod -n 50
```

### Cloudflare Tunnel Login Issues
If you can access locally but not through Cloudflare:
1. Verify `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in frontend .env matches Cloudflare URL
2. Rebuild frontend: `cd /opt/m3u-panel/frontend && sudo yarn build`
3. Restart services: `sudo systemctl restart m3u-frontend`

## 📝 Version History

### Version 1.1.2 (Current) - April 2026

**Operability & Portability Release**

**Changed:**
- Frontend now calls the backend via the relative path `/api` instead of a hardcoded `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`. The same bundle works on any origin as long as the reverse proxy forwards `/api/*` to the backend — no rebuild needed when the domain changes.

**Added:**
- Failed-login attempts are now logged with `WARNING` level, including the attempted username and client IP (honoring `X-Forwarded-For`). Three distinct failure reasons are logged: unknown username, bad password, and expired tenant. Successful logins are logged at `INFO` level.

**Removed:**
- Dead code: `frontend/src/pages/Channels_old.js` (852 lines) and `frontend/src/pages/Categories_new.js` (237 lines).

### Version 1.1.1 - April 2026

**Security Patch Release**

**Security Fixes:**
- Path traversal in backup download endpoint — super admins could previously read arbitrary server files
- Stored XSS on dashboard notes via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — now sanitized with DOMPurify + bleach
- Rotated JWT signing secret and scrubbed leaked `.env` files from git history

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed hardcoded tenant expiration default that caused new tenants to be born already expired after 2025-12-01 — now uses a rolling 1-year default

**Housekeeping:**
- Cleaned up a bloated `.gitignore` with accumulated duplicate patterns
- Added `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example`
- Started tracking `frontend/yarn.lock` for reproducible builds

**Rolled up from 1.1.1-beta:** redesigned two-column dashboard, release notes sidebar, Player API status cards, last-login tracking, enhanced probe results.

### Version 1.1.0 - October 2025

**Production Release**

**New Features:**

- Free-form text search with real-time filtering
- Tenant expiration date management with visual indicators
- Edit tenant expiration dates from admin panel
- Collapsible category groups by source
- Logo size improvements (120x80px max)

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- HTML textarea editor with live preview for dashboard notes
- Dual filtering system (dropdown + text search)
- Result counters for filtered items
- Status badges for tenant expiration (Active/Expired)
- Improved channel result grouping by source

**Security:**
- Tenant expiration check at login
- Expired tenants blocked from obtaining new tokens
- Clear 403 error messages for expired accounts

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed channel search parameter mismatch
- Fixed search results showing only single playlist
- Fixed React rendering errors with validation messages
- Fixed super admin access to categories without tenant
- Fixed MongoDB ObjectId serialization issues

- User management with tenant assignment

**User Experience:**
- Create user + tenant in one action

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloudflare Tunnel support in installer
- Virtual environment for Python dependencies
- Systemd service integration
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration

**Bug Fixes:**
